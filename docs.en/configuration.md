# Configuration Guide

ElBot uses a main configuration entry to load application configuration, Provider configuration, and runtime state. Default configurations are generated from the program's built-in assets into the platform configuration directory; existing configuration files will not be overwritten.

## Configuration File Responsibilities

All configuration files are automatically generated from the program's built-in assets to the platform configuration directory upon the first run; existing files will not be overwritten, and the `config/` directory is no longer retained in the source code.

| File or Directory | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `elnis.toml` | Elnis listening hub configuration, saving HTTP, token, delivery, allowed_tools, and Elwisp policies. |
| `state.toml` | Runtime state, e.g., default Session mode, chat/work/compact/naming model selection. |
| `tool_tags.toml` | Configuration file for adding tags and prompts to tools. |
| `SOUL.md` | The System Prompt source file for the Agent. |
| `.env` | Optional, local key file, not recommended for submission; the one automatically generated the first time is `.env.example`, and `.env` will not be generated directly. |
| `plugins/.env` | Automatically generated Hook public environment file; by default, it contains only comments, but public variables and additional `PATH` can be added. |
| `plugins/` | Hook and plugin configuration directory. |
| `skills/` | User-side Skill directory, located in the configuration directory by default; The current subdirectories are `skills/agent/` and `skills/go/`. AgentSkill can place `ELBOT_SKILL.toml` in the root directory to configure visibility or register as a regular tool. |
| `memories.toml` | Resident memory file, located in the configuration directory by default. |
| `long_memory/` | Long-term memory Markdown source data directory, located in the configuration directory by default. |

## Main configuration lookup order

The main configuration is searched in the following order upon startup:

1. Command line `--config`.
2. Environment variable `ELBOT_CONFIG_FILE`.
3. Platform configuration directory: Windows `%APPDATA%/ElBot/app.toml`; Linux uses the XDG configuration directory.
4. If the platform configuration does not exist, a default configuration file will be automatically generated in the platform configuration directory. Existing configurations will not be overwritten. Automatic generation is only triggered when there are no explicit `--config` and `ELBOT_CONFIG_FILE`. If the explicitly specified configuration path does not exist, ElBot will report an error instead of silently generating it, to avoid masking path spelling errors.

During the development phase, you can use the platform configuration directory by running it directly:

```bash
go run ./cmd/elbot
```

If you need to use a temporary configuration file, you can also explicitly specify `--config`.

## Relative Path Rules

Relative paths are resolved based on the directory of the main configuration file by default.

For example, writing `app.toml` under the platform configuration directory:

```toml
[config_files]
providers = "providers.toml"
state = "state.toml"
elnis = "elnis.toml"

[soul]
path = "SOUL.md"
```

These paths will all be resolved to the directory where the main configuration file is located; by default, this is the platform configuration directory.

## Environment Variables and Process Environment Inheritance

ElBot uses the following environment sources:

- ElBot process environment: provided by the terminal, service manager, or container at startup.
- Configuration root `.env`: located in the same directory as the main configuration file, used for Provider Keys, platform Secrets, CLI/Elnis tokens, built-in tool variables, and LLM Shell.
- `plugins/.env`: an environment layer shared by all Hooks.
- `plugins/<plugin-id>/.env`: an environment layer for individual plugin execs and Workers.

### Configuration Variables and Keys

Fields such as `api_key_env`, `token_env`, `client_secret_env`, `access_token_env`, `bot_token_env`, and `proxy_url_env` store environment variable names. When reading the corresponding values, the priority is unified as:

1. ElBot process environment.
2. Configuration root `.env`.

Variables injected by Docker Compose `env_file`, `docker run -e`, or systemd `EnvironmentFile` all belong to the ElBot process environment and may therefore be inherited by Shell / Hook subprocesses. If tools are opened to group-chat users, do not rely only on "the container is not root" to protect the API Keys in that environment.

It is recommended to place actual secrets in the system environment or the configuration root `.env`, rather than writing them directly into TOML or committing them to the repository. For example:

```dotenv
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your-api-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
QQOFFICIAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
QQONEBOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token
ELBOT_CLI_LOCAL_TOKEN=your-cli-token
ELNIS_HOME_TOKEN=your-elnis-token
```

All variables in the configuration root `.env` will also be supplemented to the LLM Shell; therefore, related tools should only be enabled when the current model and Shell permission policies are trusted.

### Shell and Hook Environments

| Process Entry Point | Environment Source and Priority |
| --- | --- |
| Built-in tools and Go Skills (including LLM Shell) | Based on the ElBot process environment, the configuration root `.env` only supplements ordinary variables that do not yet exist. |
| Root Hook Rules | Based on the ElBot process environment, `plugins/.env` overrides ordinary variables with the same name. |
| Plugin exec and Worker | Based on the root Hook environment, the `.env` in the same directory as the plugin configuration file further overrides ordinary variables with the same name. |

When ElBot reads configuration files on its own, the configuration root `.env` will not inject Hooks. Proxies, tool paths, or variables shared by all Hooks should be placed in `plugins/.env`, while variables used only by a single plugin should be placed in that plugin's `.env`. One-time exec, Persistent Worker, and Transient Worker follow the same rules.

When a proxy is required, standard variables can be set in the corresponding environment layer; whether the child process uses them still depends on the specific program:

```dotenv
HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890
NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,::1
```

### PATH Rules and systemd

When ElBot merges the above environment layers, `PATH` is not overridden like ordinary variables, but is instead appended sequentially by layer and deduplicated. The base PATH here is the process PATH that ElBot has already obtained upon startup; For subsequent `.env`, only fill in the absolute directories to be added:

```dotenv
PATH=/home/elbot/.local/bin:/usr/local/go/bin
```

Do not fill in `$PATH`, `%PATH%`, or `~`, as dotenv does not perform variable substitution or path expansion. `PATH` can be omitted if there are no additional directories.

When a systemd user service does not explicitly set the PATH, ElBot uses the PATH provided by the service manager. `EnvironmentFile` itself does not affect the PATH, but once `PATH=` is included in the file, systemd will completely overwrite the original value before starting ElBot; ElBot can only continue to append to this result and cannot recover system directories that have already been lost. systemd's `EnvironmentFile` also does not expand `$PATH`.

When ElBot reads the configuration root `.env` on its own, the systemd unit does not need to load the file again; The PATH within it is handled according to the append rules mentioned above. If the unit uses `EnvironmentFile` to load the same file, the PATH within it must be written as a full value

After loading via `EnvironmentFile`, all variables in the file belong to the ElBot process environment and will therefore be inherited by the Shell and Hook, losing the isolation effect of "configuration root `.env` is not injected into Hooks."

### Effective Timing

The configuration root `.env` or systemd environment takes effect after restarting ElBot. `plugins/.env` and plugin `.env` are re-read during startup and `/hooks reload`; a reload will rebuild the Worker based on the new environment; If the file does not exist, it is treated as an empty configuration.

## Operations Health Endpoints

When `ELBOT_HEALTH_ADDR` is set (process environment or configuration root `.env`), ElBot starts an independent HTTP health interface that does not depend on Elnis:

```dotenv
ELBOT_HEALTH_ADDR=127.0.0.1:32171
ELBOT_HEALTH_LIVE_STALE_SECONDS=90
```

`ELBOT_HEALTH_LIVE_STALE_SECONDS` should be clearly larger than the scheduling heartbeat interval; the current implementation updates the heartbeat about every 10 seconds.

- `GET /live`: whether critical scheduling loops are still progressing; a watchdog should use only this endpoint to decide whether a restart is needed.
- `GET /ready`: whether the SQLite / data directories are writable, required components are initialized, and configured platforms have connected successfully at least once.
- `GET /healthz`: aggregate status; model API failures are reported as `degraded`, and HTTP may still return 200, so they must not trigger an automatic restart of the local service.

This interface should bind only to the container internal or host loopback address; do not expose it publicly through Nginx.

## Workspace Tools

In work mode, the superadmin can allow the LLM to call the `workspace` tool to switch the shared working directory of the current Session. After switching, path-related tools such as `read_file`, `edit_file`, `send_file`, and the foreground `shell` will resolve relative paths based on this directory, avoiding the need to pass the full path every time.

When a `workspace` tool in a directory is first discovered or injected, or when switching to or resetting to that directory for the first time, if `AGENTS.md` or `AGENT.md` exists at the root of the directory, the system will automatically attach the file content to the LLM so that it can read the working conventions of the current directory. The main part of the filename must be uppercase `AGENTS` or `AGENT`, while the case of the `.md` suffix is unrestricted; `AGENTS.md` takes precedence over `AGENT.md`.

The maximum size for the automatically attached instruction file is 64 KiB. If the limit is exceeded, the content will not be read, nor will it be marked as attached; the tool result will indicate that the file needs to be shortened or split before switching the workspace.

## Resident Memory Configuration

Resident memory data is saved by default in `memories.toml` of the configuration directory, and the file is generated when the program runs for the first time. The length limits for the two resident memory segments, core and normal, can be set in the main configuration:

```toml
[resident_memory]
core_max_units = 200
normal_max_units = 300
```

The length unit `units` can be roughly understood as "Chinese by character count, English by word count": CJK characters are counted individually, and continuous segments of English/numbers are counted as one word. `core` is high-risk core memory; when ordinary users modify their own `core`, it must also be confirmed by the user themselves. `normal` is low-risk ordinary memory that can be organized directly and does not require confirmation; When injecting the Prompt, the two segments will be merged into a single piece of natural text.

## Provider Configuration

Provider is written in `providers.toml`:

```toml
[providers.deepseek]
base_url = "https://api.deepseek.com"
api_key_env = "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY"
proxy = ""                          # Optional, HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy address
extra_payload = { provider_field = "xxx" }  # Optional, Provider-level extra payload

[providers.openai]
base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key_env = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
models = ["gpt-4o-mini"]             # Manually supplemented model list (used when the API cannot retrieve them)

# Optional: configure context_window or extra_payload for specific models
# [providers.openai.model_configs."gpt-4o-mini"]
# context_window = 128000
# extra_payload = { }

[model_metadata]
default_context_window = 256000
```

Note:

- `base_url` uses the Provider's OpenAI-compatible API address.
- `api_key_env` points to an environment variable name; this method is recommended for saving keys.
- `proxy` is optional, supporting `http://` and `socks5://` proxy addresses; When omitted or left blank, it connects directly and does not inherit environment proxies such as `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` from the ElBot process. This setting applies to both the model list and chat requests.
- `models` is a manually supplemented list of model names, used when the Provider's model list interface cannot retrieve certain models.
- `[providers.<name>.model_configs."<model>"]` configures `context_window` and `extra_payload` for specific models; both are optional.
- `extra_payload` will be merged into the LLM request JSON, with model-level settings overriding provider-level settings.
- `default_context_window` of `[model_metadata]` is the global fallback value, defaulting to `256000`, and is used when `context_window` is not configured in `model_configs`.

## Built-in Web Tool Configuration

`web_search` uses `tavily`:

```env
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
```

`web_extract` prioritizes Jina Reader by default. After configuring `JINA_API_KEY`, web pages will be extracted via Jina Reader; When not configured, it falls back to direct scraping:

```env
JINA_API_KEY=your_jina_api_key
```

The `proxy` parameter of `web_extract` is used to control the proxy for webpage extraction requests:
If you want all default `web_extract` calls to go through a fixed proxy, you can set `WEB_EXTRACT_PROXY`:

```env
WEB_EXTRACT_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890
```

## LLM Request and Round Timeout

`app.toml`'s `[llm_request]` controls OpenAI-compatible streaming requests, round processing, and retries:

```toml
[llm_request]
first_chunk_timeout_seconds = 180
stream_idle_timeout_seconds = 60
response_timeout_seconds = 0
max_retries = 3
retry_initial_delay_seconds = 2
```

- `first_chunk_timeout_seconds`: The maximum wait time from the start of the response to the first streaming event, defaulting to 180 seconds, suitable for models with slower first-token generation.
- `stream_idle_timeout_seconds`: The maximum silence duration between two events during streaming, defaulting to 60 seconds; the timer resets upon receiving each new event.
- `response_timeout_seconds`: The maximum total duration for a round of user requests, from receiving user input to the end of the final response; a default of 0 indicates no time limit; When set to a positive number, processing for this round will stop when the time is reached, and the user will be notified. A single LLM streaming request is not limited by this field.
- `max_retries` and `retry_initial_delay_seconds` are used for connection failures or retryable HTTP failures, with retry delays increasing via exponential backoff.

The legacy `timeout_seconds` has been removed; existing configurations should be updated to the three new fields mentioned above.


## CLI Remote Configuration

`[platform.cli]` stores both CLI server and client configurations. `server` is the configuration read when the current ElBot runs as a server, and `clients` is the configuration read when the current command connects to the server as a CLI client.

```toml
[platform.cli]
enabled = true
default_client = "local"
default_url = "ws://127.0.0.1:32172/cli/v1/ws"

[platform.cli.server]
enabled = false
listen = "127.0.0.1:32172"

[platform.cli.server.tokens]
local = ["ELBOT_CLI_LOCAL_TOKEN"]
windows = ["ELBOT_CLI_WINDOWS_TOKEN"]

[platform.cli.clients.local]
token_env = ["ELBOT_CLI_LOCAL_TOKEN"]

[platform.cli.clients.windows]
url = "ws://192.168.1.10:32172/cli/v1/ws"
token_env = ["ELBOT_CLI_WINDOWS_TOKEN"]
```

- When `server.enabled=true`, `elbot service run` will start the CLI WebSocket server.
- `server.listen` is the server listening address. For remote CLI in containers it must be `0.0.0.0:32172`; `127.0.0.1:32172` only listens on the container loopback and is unreachable through the host port mapping. The host should still bind only `127.0.0.1` and expose HTTPS/WSS through a reverse proxy.
- `default_url` is the default client connection address; when connecting to other machines, enter the remote WebSocket address in `clients.<name>.url`.
- `server.tokens` is the list of CLI client ID and token environment variables allowed to log in to the server.
- `clients.<name>` is the client profile; `id` can be omitted, defaulting to `<name>`; `url` can be omitted, defaulting to `default_url`.
- `elbot cli -c <name>` uses the specified client profile; if not specified, `default_client` is used.

## AgentSkill Tooling Configuration

By default, AgentSkill is used only as documentation; If the script is executed according to the documentation, the risk is borne by the tools actually called, such as `shell`. To restrict the visibility of a documentation-type Skill, or to register `skills/agent/<skill>/` as a regular tool, add `ELBOT_SKILL.toml` to the root directory of that Skill. When `command`/`parameters`/`[args]` are not specified, it only serves as a visibility configuration and will not be registered as a regular tool; Once any toolization field is specified, the complete toolization configuration must be provided. The default generated `agent_skill_creator` Skill can be used to view instructions and assist in creating the file:

```toml
risk = "high"
superadmin_only = true
```

```toml
risk = "medium"
superadmin_only = false
tags = ["doc"]
command = ["python", "foo.py"]
timeout_seconds = 30
expose_root = false

parameters = '''
{
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["input"],
  "properties": {
    "input": {"type": "string", "description": "输入文本"}
  }
}
'''

[args]
input = "--input"
```

Field descriptions:

- `risk`: Optional, allows `safe`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`; Required when registering as a regular tool. When not specified for a documentation-type Skill, it is handled according to `safe`.
- `superadmin_only`: Optional. `true` indicates that only the ElBot superadmin can discover, preload, or call this Skill.
- `tags`: Optional, equivalent to categorizing the tool, which can be used for `@tool:<tag>` preloading.
- `command`: Required for toolization; a command array, do not use shell strings.
- `parameters`: Required for toolization; a JSON object schema that determines the tool parameters seen by the LLM.
- `[args]`: Required for toolization; a flat parameter mapping. `input = "--input"` will translate tool parameter `input` into `--input <value>`.
- `timeout_seconds`: Optional, command timeout.
- `expose_root`: Optional, defaults to `false`; when set to `true`, the Skill root path will be exposed upon discovering the Skill.

ElBot only reads `ELBOT_SKILL.toml` in the Skill root directory and does not scan recursively. The working directory during execution is fixed to the Skill root directory, and stdout will serve as the tool result; If stdout is `{"content":"..."}` JSON, the `content` field will be used.

Media parameters can be declared as `{"type":"media"}` in `parameters.properties`, and flags are still mapped via `[args]`. The LLM sees the string schema and passes the full `media:<sha256>`; the host only exports this parameter as a temporary file path relative to the Skill root directory during execution. Strings not declared as media are not converted. stdout also supports returning media IDs or controlled relative file paths via `segments`; for specific formats and lifecycles, see [Skill Using Media](concepts.md#skill-使用媒体).

When writing configuration via the `agent_skill` meta-tool, ElBot will only confirm the write after a complete reload is successful; If the reload fails, the original TOML will be restored; if the file did not exist previously, the newly created file will be deleted.

## Go Skill Compiler Path

After modifying the `code_source` of the Go Skill, ElBot will automatically execute `gofmt`, `go build`, and reload. The Go executable is located according to the following rules.

It is recommended to specify the Go executable in the configuration directory `.env`:

```dotenv
ELBOT_GO_BINARY=/usr/local/go/bin/go
```

Lookup order:

1. System environment variable `ELBOT_GO_BINARY`.
2. `ELBOT_GO_BINARY` in the configuration directory `.env`.
3. `GOROOT/bin/go`, if `GOROOT` is configured in the service environment.
4. `go` in the ElBot process `PATH`.

If using asdf, mise, Nix, Linuxbrew, Snap, or a custom installation path, it is recommended to write the actual `go` path directly into `ELBOT_GO_BINARY`, rather than relying on the initialization scripts of an interactive shell.

For advanced deployments, this can also be specified in the systemd service:

```ini
[Service]
Environment=ELBOT_GO_BINARY=/usr/local/go/bin/go
```

## Session Configuration

`[session.idle_expiration]` in `app.toml` controls the idle expiration time of the current Session, in minutes:

```toml
[session.idle_expiration]
group_user_ttl_minutes = 10
group_superadmin_ttl_minutes = 10
private_user_ttl_minutes = 10
private_superadmin_ttl_minutes = 0
```

Field descriptions:

- `group_user_ttl_minutes`: Idle expiration time of the current Session for ordinary users in group chats.
- `group_superadmin_ttl_minutes`: Idle expiration time of the current Session for superadmins in group chats.
- `private_user_ttl_minutes`: Idle expiration time of the current Session for ordinary users in private chats.
- `private_superadmin_ttl_minutes`: Idle expiration time of the current Session for superadmins in private chats.
- Setting any field to `0` disables idle expiration for the corresponding scenario.

Under the default configuration, both regular users and superadmins in group chats will start a new Session after being idle for 10 minutes; In private chats, regular users will start a new Session after being idle for 10 minutes; In private chats, superadmins do not expire.

Here, "superadmin" refers to the ElBot superadmin configured in `[security.superadmins]`. Platform group owners or group administrators who are not in the superadmin list will still be handled according to the regular user rules.

## Model Status Configuration

`state.toml` saves the runtime model selection:


```toml
[session]
default_mode = "work"

[mode_models.work]
provider = "deepseek"
model = "deepseek-chat"

[mode_models.chat]
provider = "deepseek"
model = "deepseek-chat"

[mode_models.elwisp1]
provider = "deepseek"
model = "deepseek-chat"

[mode_models.elwisp2]
provider = "deepseek"
model = "deepseek-chat"

[mode_models.elwisp3]
provider = "deepseek"
model = "deepseek-chat"
```

- `default_mode` determines whether a new Session defaults to `chat` or `work`.
- `work` mode enables tool discovery and tool calling.
- `chat` mode does not inject tools, making it suitable for casual chatting and low-cost conversations.
- `elwisp1`, `elwisp2`, and `elwisp3` are optional model slots for Elnis LLM events; Elvena requests can be specified via `model_slot`, falling back to `work` when not configured.
- After switching models using `/model` at runtime, the state will be written back to `state.toml`.

## Storage and Runtime Data

Storage-related configurations in `app.toml`:

```toml
[storage]
sessions_sqlite_path = ""
chat_history_sqlite_path = ""
# Disk protection: ratios are used-space ratios; critical refuses non-essential media writes.
disk_warn_ratio = 0.85
disk_critical_ratio = 0.95
disk_min_free_bytes = 0
```

When left blank, the platform's default data directory is used:

- Windows：`%APPDATA%/ElBot/data`
- Linux: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/elbot` or `~/.local/share/elbot`
- `disk_warn_ratio` / `disk_critical_ratio` classify used-space ratios; when `disk_min_free_bytes` is positive, free space below it is immediately critical. In critical state, image generation, images, voice, video, and ordinary file saves are rejected, while SQLite sessions and configuration writes remain allowed.

Runtime logs, SQLite, sandbox, and other runtime data will also be stored according to the configuration or the default data directory.

Platform inbound attachment download limits use `[platform_files]`:

```toml
[platform_files]
max_receive_file_bytes = 104857600
download_timeout_secs = 60
```

- `max_receive_file_bytes`: Maximum media reception size, defaults to 100MB; a prompt indicating that the media is unavailable will be shown if the limit is exceeded or the media cannot be retrieved.
- `download_timeout_secs`: Media download timeout, defaults to 60 seconds; Telegram uses the platform API timeout.
- Platform media is only downloaded during actual processing and is not automatically saved to the sandbox upon receipt. Pure file messages are also handled according to the unified platform wake-up rules.


### Media Delivery

`[file_delivery]` of `app.toml` controls media delivery in model requests: `base64` uses embedded data, `s3` uses pre-signed download links, and `hybrid` uses S3 when the total size of request media exceeds `max_direct_base64_bytes`. After switching to S3, existing local media will be uploaded when remote delivery is required, reusing the recorded object keys.

S3 delivery uses variables specified by `s3_endpoint`, `s3_region`, `s3_bucket`, as well as `s3_access_key_env` and `s3_secret_key_env`. The model service downloads objects via pre-signed URLs valid for 1 hour, and no additional keys are required. Cloudflare R2 can keep the bucket private without needing to enable public access; The model service or relay service that actually downloads the files must be able to access the link.

`[media]` controls image compression upon storage: `llm_image_compression_threshold_bytes` is the original image byte size threshold that triggers compression (default 4 MiB), and `llm_image_max_length` is the side length limit (default 4096). Images are compressed proportionally when the original image byte size exceeds the threshold or any side length reaches the limit.


## Logs and Maintenance Tasks

Runtime log configuration:

```toml
[runtime]
log_level = "info"
log_retention_days = 30
```

Maintenance task examples:

```toml
[maintenance.log_cleanup]
enabled = true
schedule = "0 3 * * *"
```

Cron expressions are scheduled by the internal Cron Runtime, using the Linux crontab-style 5-field format: `分钟 小时 日 月 星期`. Default maintenance tasks include the cleanup of logs, Sessions, sandboxes, and chat history. For example, Session cleanup defaults to a 30-day retention period, sandbox content older than 7 days is cleaned up daily at 04:00 by default, and chat history cleanup is executed daily at 04:35 by default:

```toml
[maintenance.session_cleanup]
enabled = false
schedule = "15 3 * * *"
retention_days = 30
```

```toml
[maintenance.sandbox_cleanup]
enabled = true
schedule = "0 4 * * *"
retention_days = 7
```

```toml
[maintenance.chat_history_cleanup]
enabled = true
schedule = "35 4 * * *"
retention_days = 180
```

## Context and Compaction

```toml
[context]
compact_enabled = true
compact_trigger_ratio = 0.8
```

- When enabled, compaction will be triggered when the Session context approaches the window limit.
- You can also manually compress the current Session via `/compact`.
- After successful compaction, it will switch to a new independent Session without modifying the history of the original Session.

The model window is configured in `model_configs` of `providers.toml`:

```toml
[providers.deepseek.model_configs."deepseek-chat"]
context_window = 64000

[model_metadata]
default_context_window = 256000
```

- `[model_metadata].default_context_window` is the global fallback value, defaulting to `256000`, and is used when `context_window` is not configured in the model block.

## Command Prefix

```toml
[commands]
prefixes = ["/"]
```

`/` is used by default. If you want to support other command prefixes, you can add them here.

## Tools and Security

```toml
[config_files]
tool_tags = "tool_tags.toml"

[tools]
max_rounds_per_turn = 10

[security]
user_max_tool_risk = "low"
superadmin_confirm_risk = "high"

[security.superadmins]
cli = ["local"]
```

- Ordinary users can only discover and call tools within the permitted risk range; after a tool passes permission verification, ``high``/``critical`` risk calls still require confirmation by the current user.
- ``OwnerScoped`` tools can only access the caller's own data, so ordinary users can call them; among these, ``high``/``critical`` risk operations still require confirmation by the user themselves.
- The confirmation threshold for the superadmin is configured by ``superadmin_confirm_risk``.
- The default local CLI user `local` is a superadmin.
- If image generation is opened to regular users, keep `[image_generation] superadmin_only = true`, or set quota, rate limits, and daily caps per Key at the relay.
- `tool_tags.toml` is used to configure the tool groups that can be injected into `@tool:<tag>`, as well as the tool usage strategies appended to the system prompt after a tag is activated.

### `tool_tags.toml`

`tool_tags.toml` is a standalone configuration file, with its path specified by `[config_files].tool_tags`. Relative paths are based on the directory where `app.toml` is located:

```toml
[config_files]
tool_tags = "tool_tags.toml"
```

The file format uses tags as entry points:

```toml
[tags.agent]
tools = ["read_file", "edit_file", "shell"]
prompt = """
ROLE:
- The goal is to complete the user's task safely and accurately.

MUST:
- Inspect relevant files before editing.
- Prefer minimal, verifiable changes.
- Evaluate command safety before running shell commands.
"""
```

Field descriptions:

- `[tags.<tag-name>]`: Define a tag that can be used in chat, for example, `[tags.agent]` corresponds to `@tool:agent` or the shorthand `@t:agent`.
- `tools`: A list of tool names that this tag will preload. Tool names must be registered tools that the current user has permission to access.
- `prompt`: The tool usage strategy appended to the system prompt after this tag is successfully activated. The content will be presented directly to the model without automatically adding a tag name header.

Usage:

```text
@tool:agent 帮我检查这个项目的问题
@t:agent 帮我检查这个项目的问题
```

This will preload the tools configured under `agent` into the current Session. If `prompt` is not empty, it will also be appended to the system prompt starting from this round.

Notes:

- Configured tags will be appended to built-in tags, not overwrite them.
- Only after `@tool:<tag>` or `@t:<tag>` successfully hits at least one tool will the current Session activate the prompt for that tag.
- Directly using `@tool:<tool-name>` or `@t:<tool-name>` only preloads the specified tools and does not activate the tag prompt.
- Activated tags are written to the Session metadata and remain effective after `/resume`.
- Prompt text is dynamically read from `tool_tags.toml`; changes to the file affect subsequent requests, behaving similarly to `SOUL.md`.
- When preloading tools that already exist, they will not be added again, and the platform will prompt `已存在工具：<name>`.
- It is recommended to write `prompt` as a specific tool usage strategy, rather than configuration mechanisms that the model does not need to know, such as "the current tag is xxx".

## Operational Timeouts and Concurrency Limits

```toml
[ops]
# Per-tool / Hook / context-compaction timeout; 0 means unlimited.
tool_timeout_seconds = 600
hook_timeout_seconds = 60
compress_timeout_seconds = 300
# Maximum concurrently running turns / tools / hooks; 0 means unlimited.
max_concurrent_turns = 4
max_concurrent_tools = 4
max_concurrent_hooks = 4
# Optional per-user / per-group rate limits; 0 disables the limiter.
user_messages_per_minute = 12
user_burst = 3
group_messages_per_minute = 60
group_burst = 10
rate_limit_idle_ttl_seconds = 600
# Optional bounded queue when concurrency is saturated. turn usually should not wait.
queue_max_size = 20
queue_wait_timeout_seconds = 10
queue_wait_kinds = ["tool", "hook", "compress"]
# Optional provider circuit breaker; 0 disables it.
circuit_breaker_failure_threshold = 0
circuit_breaker_open_cooldown_seconds = 60
circuit_breaker_half_open_max = 1
```

- Tool, Hook, and context-compaction timeouts cancel the work through `context`; timed-out requests finish with an error and release their concurrency slot.
- Per-user / per-group rate limits use a token bucket keyed by platform + scope; over-limit messages receive a retry notice and do not enter the LLM or tool chain. Superadmins are exempt.
- `queue_wait_kinds` controls which request kinds may wait when concurrency is saturated; `turn` is rejected by default to avoid user-visible stalls, and a full queue or queue timeout is also rejected explicitly.
- The breaker tracks provider connection failures, first-chunk timeouts, 5xx responses, and stream errors. It opens after the configured failure threshold, then allows a small half-open probe after cooldown. User cancellation and whole-turn response timeouts do not count.

Providers can configure a fallback:

```toml
[providers.openai]
fallback_provider = "deepseek"
fallback_model = "deepseek-chat"
```

When the primary breaker is open, ElBot uses the fallback provider; without one it returns a clear error instead of retrying forever. External model failures appear as `degraded` and do not trigger an automatic restart.
- Concurrency limits cap the number of active requests per kind; over-limit requests return `request concurrency limit reached` instead of accumulating without bound.
- Active tasks, start time, stage, latest progress, and resource metrics can be viewed through the independent health endpoints `/tasks` and `/metrics`.
- On supported platforms, Shell, Hooks, AgentSkill, and Go Skill processes are terminated as a process tree on timeout or cancellation; in-process work such as image handling can only rely on `context` cancellation, and third-party libraries that ignore cancellation may still release late.

## Elnis listening hub

Elnis is disabled by default. Once enabled, ElBot will start a local HTTP ingress to receive events delivered by Elwisp according to the Elvena protocol. It is recommended to split the Elnis configuration into a separate `elnis.toml`, while `app.toml` only retains the entry path.

```toml
[config_files]
elnis = "elnis.toml"

# elnis.toml
enabled = true
allowed_tools = ["shell", "web_search"]

[http]
addr = "127.0.0.1:32170"
max_body_bytes = 1048576
queue_size = 128
workers = 2

[tokens.home]
token_env = ["ELNIS_HOME_TOKEN", "ELNIS_HOME_TOKEN_ALT"]

[delivery_disabled]
targets = [
  # { platform = "telegram" },
  # { platform = "telegram", type = "private", id = "123456789" },
  # { platform = "qqonebot", type = "group", id = "987654321" },
]

[elwisps.server-watchdog]
allowed_tokens = ["home"]
allowed_tools = ["shell"]
disabled_external_tools = ["danger_tool"]
disabled_targets = [
  # { platform = "qqonebot", type = "group", id = "987654321" },
]
```

Note:

- `allowed_tools` is the Elnis internal tool whitelist; Elwisps without separate configurations inherit the global default.
- If a single Elwisp configures `allowed_tools`, it will override the global default.
- External tools are allowed by default; specified external tools are only disabled when a single Elwisp configures `disabled_external_tools`.
- Elnis delivery is allowed by default; `[delivery_disabled].targets` and single Elwisp `disabled_targets` are used to explicitly prohibit platforms, private chats, or group chats; `platform-only` in the configuration indicates that all deliveries for the entire platform are disabled.
- Elnis logs only record the token name, not the original token text.
- `token_env` can be written as a list to try multiple environment variable names in order; this is suitable for temporarily switching tokens or achieving multi-environment compatibility.
- When Elnis is enabled in a container, `[http].addr` must be `0.0.0.0:32170`, while the host port maps only to `127.0.0.1`; ElBot disables Elnis by default, and `/healthz` cannot represent the health of ElBot / the model / OneBot when Elnis is disabled.
- Elwisp is enabled by default; the corresponding Elwisp will only be disabled if `enabled=false` is explicitly configured.
- Currently, `record`, `direct`, and `llm` modes are supported; `llm` mode is executed using a background Session runner.
- In `llm` mode, `model_slot` can be specified as `elwisp1`, `elwisp2`, or `elwisp3` in Elvena requests; If not specified or if the corresponding slot is not configured, it will fall back to the `work` model.
- `direct` and `llm` reports only support sending to superadmins via the platform decided by Elnis, and do not support arbitrary user/group targets.
- `tools` in Elvena requests enters the validation, persistence, and execution chain; external tool names are still controlled by the denylist of individual Elwisps.

## Platform Configuration

CLI enabled by default:

```toml
[platform.cli]
enabled = true
```

Configurations for QQ Official Bot, QQ OneBot, and Telegram are commented out by default in the examples. When enabled, the platform's own authentication information and trigger keywords must be provided. Media is downloaded according to the `[platform_files]` limit during actual processing.

Minimum configuration example for the official QQ bot:

```toml
[platform.qqofficial]
enabled = true
app_id = "your-app-id"
client_secret_env = "QQOFFICIAL_CLIENT_SECRET"
trigger_keywords = ["bot"]
```

The corresponding configuration directory `.env`:

```dotenv
QQOFFICIAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```

`client_secret_env` points to the environment variable name that stores the Client Secret; You can also use `client_secret` to write configurations directly, but it is not recommended to commit actual Secrets.

The QQ official bot handles private chats, @ mentions in groups, and ordinary group messages actually delivered by the platform. Group chats follow the unified wake-up rules: slash commands, `trigger_keywords`, @ mentioning the bot, or quoting the bot's historical replies will trigger a response; Ordinary group messages that do not trigger a response will still be written to the chat history. Whether ordinary group messages are delivered depends on the group message capabilities enabled for the bot by the QQ Open Platform.

Minimum configuration example for QQ OneBot:

```toml
[platform.qqonebot]
enabled = true
ws_url = "ws://127.0.0.1:6700/"
access_token_env = "QQONEBOT_ACCESS_TOKEN"
api_timeout_seconds = 15 # Base timeout for OneBot write and response wait
trigger_keywords = ["bot"]
send_file_mode = "base64" # Local images, files, and voice messages use base64 by default; for shared file systems, this can be changed to file_uri
```

> **Container deployment note**: `ws_url` is the address reached **from inside the ElBot container**. `ws://127.0.0.1:6700/` points to ElBot itself. If OneBot is another service in the same Compose project (or on the same Docker network), use the service name, for example `ws://onebot:6700/`; if OneBot runs on the host, configure an address reachable from the container (on Linux, add `extra_hosts: ["host.docker.internal:host-gateway"]` and use `ws://host.docker.internal:6700/`); if it runs on another machine, use that machine's IP/domain.

`access_token_env` points to the environment variable name that stores the Access Token; The original `access_token` remains compatible and takes priority over `access_token_env`. When OneBot does not require authentication, both items can be omitted.

`send_file_mode` simultaneously controls the sending method for QQ OneBot local images, files, and `record` voice messages. `base64` is suitable for deployments where ElBot and OneBot do not share a file system; `file_uri` is only applicable in scenarios where both parties can access the same local path.

`api_timeout_seconds` serves as the base timeout for OneBot frame writing and API response waiting, respectively. For large frame writes, 1 second will be added for every full 1 MiB of encoded size, up to a maximum of the base timeout itself; After a write failure or timeout, ElBot will disconnect and reconnect to OneBot to prevent a slow send from blocking subsequent messages for a long time. Sending will still synchronously wait for the platform receipt.

Telegram uses Bot API long polling. Minimum configuration example:

```toml
[security.superadmins]
cli = ["local"]
telegram = ["123456789"]

[platform.telegram]
enabled = true
bot_token_env = "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
proxy_url_env = "TELEGRAM_PROXY_URL" # Optional
trigger_keywords = ["bot"]
format = "html" # html/plain/rich
stream_edit_interval_milliseconds = 250
```

Note:

- `bot_token_env` points to the environment variable name that stores the Bot Token; `bot_token` can also be used to write it directly into the configuration, but it is not recommended to commit actual tokens.
- `proxy_url_env` points to the environment variable name that stores the proxy address; You can also use `proxy_url` to write the configuration directly. Proxy address examples: `http://127.0.0.1:7890`, `socks5://127.0.0.1:1080`.
- `format="html"` is the default value: uses standard `sendMessage` + `parse_mode="HTML"`, and performs a lightweight conversion of common Markdown to Telegram HTML; Supports readable rendering of headings, quotes, horizontal rules, code blocks, and tables, with automatic plain text retry upon failure.
- `format="plain"` disables formatting and sends only plain text.
- `format="rich"` is an experimental mode: uses `sendRichMessage` / private chat `sendRichMessageDraft`, and automatically falls back to HTML if Rich Message fails; Some clients may not be able to view Rich Messages.
- `stream_edit_interval_milliseconds` controls the streaming refresh throttle interval, defaulting to 250ms, to avoid triggering platform rate limits.
- After the connection is successfully established, ElBot will synchronize built-in slash commands to the Telegram bot command menu; only main command names are synchronized, not aliases.
- In group chats/supergroups, command prefixes, trigger keywords, `@bot_username`, or replying to bot messages will all trigger processing. Private chats are processed by default.
- Confirmation messages for high-risk tools will be accompanied by a Telegram inline keyboard; clicking buttons will convert them into existing confirmation commands such as `/confirm` and `/reject`.
- Fill `security.superadmins.telegram` with a Telegram user ID or a private chat ID that can be sent to directly, used for superadmin permissions and notification delivery.


## Plugin and Hook Configuration

Plugin configurations are fixed under `plugins/` in the configuration directory:

- `plugins/hooks.toml`: Rule Hook configuration.
- `plugins/<plugin-id>/hook.toml`: Plugin Hooks referenced by `hooks.toml`; Can contain `[plugin.runtime]` persistent runtime configuration.
- `plugins/_shared/`: A cross-Hook file collaboration directory created by ElBot, not scanned as a plugin.

Hooks should not send platform messages directly; they should return an output intent, which is then handed over to the Output Manager by the Agent for sending.

For complete configuration instructions for rules and persistent Hooks, see [Hook](hooks.md).

## Recommended Maintenance Method


- User-editable configurations should be centralized in the platform configuration directory to avoid directly modifying source code examples.
- Update this document synchronously when adding new configuration items.
- Update [Quick Start](getting-started.md) and README synchronously when changing default paths or startup behavior.
