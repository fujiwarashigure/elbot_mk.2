# ElBot Documentation

This is the user-facing ElBot documentation. Development plans, task breakdowns, and internal design materials have been moved to [`../devdocs/`](../devdocs/).

## Recommended Reading Order

1. [Quick Start](getting-started.md): From configuring the API Key to launching the CLI, complete your first conversation.
2. [Configuration Guide](configuration.md): Learn about configuration files, path rules, Providers, runtime data, and plugin directories.
3. [Command Cheat Sheet](commands.md): View common slash commands and Session management methods.
4. [Core Concepts](concepts.md): Understand Chat / Work modes, tool discovery, Session, Hook, Cron, Skill, and security policies.
5. [Hook](hooks.md): Rule Hook configuration, action types, segments multi-part output, exec scripts, and emoji extraction examples.
6. [Elnis Listening Hub](elnis.md): Learn about Elnis, Elwisp, Elvena, and external event access.
7. [Elnis Configuration and Usage](elnis-usage.md): Enable Elnis, configure Elwisp, and deliver events using Elvena.
8. [Frontend API](frontend-api.md): WebSocket protocol, message types, and completion interfaces, used for writing custom frontends.
9. [Deployment and operations](../deploy/README.md): cloud / Linux container deployment, health endpoints, watchdog, backup and restore, upgrade and rollback, plus [local Windows container deployment](../deploy/windows/README.md).

## Documentation Maintenance Conventions

- `README` only retains the project introduction, quick entry points, and the minimum startup path.
- `docs/` contains user documentation, avoiding the inclusion of development task logs.
- `devdocs/` is used for development plans, task breakdowns, architecture, and interfaces.
- When adding user-visible features, prioritize updating the corresponding topic documentation instead of stuffing all details into the README.
- `CHANGELOG.md` is the Chinese source file, and `CHANGELOG.en.md` is automatically translated by GitHub Actions; do not edit it manually; Using versions (tags) as nodes, regular changes should be written into `## [Unreleased]`; when releasing, change it to `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` and create a new empty Unreleased.

## Current Status

ElBot is still under development; configurations, commands, and extension interfaces may be adjusted. Documentation prioritizes coverage of current stable and commonly used paths; experimental capabilities will be labeled as such where possible.
